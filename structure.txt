Ski Resort Structure — UML/Class Project Synthesis 

I. Context

Domain model for a ski resort: Separated between POIs, Ski Areas, Persons and Passes. Main use cases would be issuing/checking validity of passes, populating the resort with crew & pister using live affluence and meteorological conditions, and also display the status of slopes and rescue points on interactive maps.

III. Features

Pass: issue different types of passes, check their validity, give user info
Person: map their role, attached location (restaurant for R&B crew, rescue point for pisters...), give out their status/schedule
Terrain: Display opening hours or emergency status, give out snow and weather report when needed. Map their position and elevation, and allow for use a shortest path algorithm between them.
